Description: service to relaunch Pantheon shell components
 Cerbere is a sort of watchdog designed for Pantheon. It monitors a predefined
 list of processes (configurable through GSettings) and relaunches them if they
 end. This is helpful to keep the panel, dock, and wallpaper running, even if
 they crash or are killed by another process.
